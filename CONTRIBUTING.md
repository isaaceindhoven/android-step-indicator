# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project!

There are multiple ways you can help improve this package: Reporting bug, suggesting features, and contributing code implementing said features and bug requests.

## Reporting bugs

Before submitting a bug request, please check if this bug has already been reported by checking the existing [issues](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/testcafe-reporter-allure/labels/bug).

Please adhere to the Bug Report template provided in the repository when creating a new issue. This will help us with organizing, reproducing, and ultimately solving the bug.

## Suggesting features

Before submitting a feature suggestion, please check if this feature has already been suggested by checking the existing [issues](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/testcafe-reporter-allure/labels/feature).

Please adhere to the Feature Request template provided in the repository when creating a new issue. This will help us in organizing, prioritizing, and implementing new features.

Note that a feature request can have three different  outcomes:
- The feature request is accepted and will be implemented.
- The feature request is accepted; however, the implementation priority is low. With these features, external developers are welcomed to implement this feature themselves and create a Pull Request.
- The feature request is rejected. The suggested feature may be deemed not to be beneficial to the project as a whole if implemented. Pull Requests containing this feature will not be merged. If you feel that this feature should still be implemented, with this being an open-source project, feel free to create a fork with the feature included.
